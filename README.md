# brainfuck-interpreter
Simple interpreter for the esoteric programming language 'Brainfuck' written in C++.
Some days ago I had enough time to dive a little deeper into the programming language Brainfuck (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) and decided that it was easy enough to do a little interpreter in C++.
It was compiled using Visual C++ 2017.

# Usage
brainfuck-interpreter.exe filename.bf on the Shell.
